## Layers

| Layer | Name | Activation | Description |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|
| 0 | Default | Base | Full QWERTY with function row, number row, and symbols |
| 1 | Numpad & Nav | `mo 1` | Left-hand numpad (7-8-9 / 4-5-6 / 1-2-3 / 0), right-hand arrow navigation with Home/End |
| 2 | Keyboard Control | `mo 2` | Bluetooth profile selection (5 slots), RGB underglow controls, system reset/bootloader |
| 3 | Auto Mouse | `to 4` | Mouse button layer with left/middle/right click on left hand home row |
| 4 | Factory Test | `to 4` | Sequential number key test for hardware validation |

## Features

- **Split wireless** via Bluetooth (Assimilator-BT board)
- **5 Bluetooth profiles** with per-slot selection and clear
- **RGB underglow** with full control (toggle, effect, hue, saturation, brightness, speed)
- **Dual trackballs** -- left trackball configured for scrolling (with Y-invert), right trackball available for cursor
- **Mouse clicks** on a dedicated layer (left, middle, right click)
- **Function row + number row + full bottom row** layout (`imprint_function_row_full_bottom_row` transform)

## Trackball Configuration

The left trackball is configured as a scroll wheel by default:
- Sensitivity scaled down (1/3) for comfortable scrolling
- Y-axis inverted so the view moves with the trackball direction

The right trackball configuration is commented out but ready to enable with automatic mouse layer activation.

## Building

Firmware builds automatically via GitHub Actions on every push. The workflow uses the [ZMK user config build action](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-user-config.yml) and produces separate firmware files for left and right halves.

To trigger a build manually, use the **Run workflow** button on the Actions tab.

## Keymap Diagram

The keymap SVG is auto-generated by [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer) via a separate GitHub Actions workflow. It regenerates whenever files in `config/` or `keymap_drawer.config.yaml` change, and commits the updated diagram back to the repo.
